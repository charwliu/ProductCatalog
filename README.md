# TMF Product Catalog Management API RI

## Introduction

This is the code repository for the reference implementation of the TM Forum Catalog Management API, used as part of
the NGBOSS Ecosystem Engagement Platform.

## API Overview

The Product Catalog Management API provides a standardized solution for adding rapidly partners’ products to an
existing Catalog.

It brings the capability for Service Providers to directly feed partners’ systems with the technical
description of the products they propose to them.

This reduces Catalog definition time and errors for offerings based on partners’ products
